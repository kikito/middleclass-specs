h1. MiddleClass specs

These are the specs of "middleclass":http://github.com/kikito/middleclass and "middleclass-extras":http://github.com/kikito/middleclass-extras.

These specs have been implemented using "telescope":http://github.com/norman/telescope

They are a series of tests that verify that the current implementation of MiddleClass works as expected. It is recommended to run them after modifying MiddleClass.

h2. Prerequisites

First step is installing telescope. The easiest way in ubuntu is installing luarocks and then telescope itself:

<pre>
sudo apt-get install lua luarocks
sudo luarocks build telescope --from=http://luarocks.luaforge.net/rocks-cvs/
</pre>

The first command might ask about installing some dependencies; answer (y)es to that.

h2. Installation

Get the code from github normally, and then update the submodules (*don't forget this step, otherwise middleclass and middleclass-extras will not be downloaded and you will not be able to run the specs!*)

<pre>
git clone git://github.com/kikito/middleclass-specs.git
git submodule init
git submodule update
</pre>

h2. Test execution

Open a console and change to the middleclass-specs top-directory. Then execute @lua run.lua@. It should be configured to start the testing automatically.

<pre>
cd your/path/to/middleclass-specs
lua run.lua
</pre>

If everything has been set up properly, you should see lost of testing being done, and, hopefully, passing.
